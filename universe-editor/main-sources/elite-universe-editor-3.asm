\       Type: Subroutine
\   Category: Universe editor
\    Summary: Save or load a universe file
\
\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\
\ The filename should be stored at INWK, terminated with a carriage return (13).
\ The routine asks for a drive number and updates the filename accordingly
\ before performing the load or save.
\
\ Arguments:
\
\   A                   File operation to be performed. Can be one of the
\                       following:
\
\                         * 0 (save file)
\
\                         * &FF (load file)
\
\ Returns:
\
\   C flag              Set if an invalid drive number was entered
\
\ Other entry points:
\
\   slod3               Contains an RTS
